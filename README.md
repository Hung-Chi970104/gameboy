# Pico Gameboy
I came across with this DIY Gameboy video made of Raspberry Pi Pico and inspired me to build my own version. The fact that RP2040 has dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor makes it capable of running some light emulators. So I’ll build a little handheld game console using RP2040 that can run gameboy!
